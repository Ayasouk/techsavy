If you are sensible on the tech news daily you certainly heard about ALOHA, a hardware system for exosqueleton that has been released and is IMPRESSIVE.
The creators of this tech are disrupting the field by providing an exosqueleton with a challenging precision and this only for less than 20k$ !
 something that never happened in the exosqueleton industry.
They shared images and videos when we can see the device play with a ping pong ball or doing precise task.
The device is developed by Stanford, Berkeley and Meta. It's a teleoperating system that does bimanual operation. Check their website to learn more about it.
